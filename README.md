README File
========================================================
Intro: 
This file is built from the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0
This data and additional descriptors can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#

========================================================
Purpose:

This repo contains the R script run_analysis that tidys up the combination of test and train files in the initial UCI data set and saves this new tidy data set containing only the mean and standard deviation variables averaged across activity and subject.
This repo also contains a code book to describe the transformations to the variables in the final tidy data set and the steps used to reach this data set.
Finally, this repo contains this readme file which explains how the scripts work and how they are connected.

There is only 1 R script in this repo and can be run by opening it through R. Please note this R script assumed you have downloaded and unzipped the UCI data set mentioned above. You will also need the plyr package. You may need to up the wd at the start of the code and the end of the code when the final data set is saved.
